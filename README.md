The Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cse151b-spring2022/overview

In this project, we built several predictive models using deep learning for forecasting autonomous vehicles motions. The task was to predict the positions of a tracked AV in the next 6 seconds, given the previous 5 seconds positions. 

Our team name is Deep Wrangler, ranked 4th on the leaderboard.
